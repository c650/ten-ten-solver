There is a 10x10 board. There are three available pieces that have to be
inserted into the board.

Each time you insert a piece, a new piece is given to you for your use.
If you cannot insert _any_ piece you have, the game ends.

* Load and provide pieces: Done.

TODO: Allow for pieces to be read from a file.
